This mod includes:

- Custom textures on every main map

- Custom default weapons skins
- Custom kill icons for every type of kill (2x, 3x, nailed, drilled, etc...)
- Custom UI (Thanks to twitch.tv/tomogunchi)
- Custom thumbnails (challenges, maps, skins, etc...)

Thanks to:

- Gunchi (or twitch.tv/tomogunchi) for providing most of the menu UI script
