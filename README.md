My mod for venge.io

This mod includes:

- Custom textures on every main map
- Custom sounds on all main weapons
- Custom icons
- Custom default weapons
- Custom kill icons for every type of kill (2x, 3x, nailed, drilled, etc...)
- Custom UI (Thanks to twitch.tv/tomogunchi)
- Custom thumbnails (challenges, maps, etc...)
- Removes annoying/unecessary textures (snow on tundra, rain on temple, etc...)
- Changes default spray

Thanks to:

- Gunchi (or twitch.tv/tomogunchi) for providing most of the menu UI script and helping me out with ideas
- The venge.io discord server for helping me out with ideas and comments (most notably llama, PR3R4K (Aka KittyCat), Kayta, Zip, and StreamKing)

WIP's for my next mod update

- Optimized textures
- Custom sounds on all weapons
- Smooth textures for those who want them
